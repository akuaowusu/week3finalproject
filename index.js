//maybe have 4 classes: a,b,c,d
//we store which class the user picks for each question in an array
//give a cactus based off which class they picked the most
    //so we calculate which letter occurs the most in the array once there's 5 letters
//if we go for 5 questions what happens if they pick 2 a's 2 b's and 1 c?
//how will the results show up? in an alert? link to a new page?
